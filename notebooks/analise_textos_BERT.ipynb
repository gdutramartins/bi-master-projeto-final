            " Sentence: Apos o governo ensaiar um recuo na proposta de financiar o Renda Cidada com dinheiro dos precatorios, o dia de ontem terminou com uma indefinicao em torno de como se pretende custear o programa social bolsonarista. Momentos depois de o ministro da Economia, Paulo Guedes, ter defendido um a fonte de recursos \"saudavel, limpa e permanente\" para o programa, o senador Marcio Bittar (MDB-AC), relator das PECs do Pacto Federativo e do auxilio emergencial, disse ao Valor que a ideia de usar os precatorios para essa finalidade estara implicita no texto, que ele esta finalizando. Ontem, enquanto membros do governo propagavam a versao de que Guedes foi \"atropelado\" nas discussões, Bittar afirmava que a ideia teve aval do presidente Jair Bolsonaro e do ministro. \"Um projeto dessa magnitude jamais seria apresentado se nao tivesse o conhecimento e a aprovação do presidente da nacao e o carimbo de 'ok' do ministro da Economia\", afirmou. Ontem pela manha, um ministro disse ao Valor que a ideia foi apresentada a equipe economica, mas que ainda nao tinha o aval do governo quando foi apresentada, em entrevista coletiva no Palacio da Alvorada, na segunda. Uma outra fonte palaciana havia dado a mesma versao na noite anterior, tambem falando sob anonimato. Bittar nao quis dizer de quem foi a autoria da proposta. E afirmou que a vinculacao entre os precatorios e o Renda Cidada nao sera explicita no seu projeto. \"O texto que vamos apresentar nao estara dizendo que o dinheiro do precatorio vai criar o programa. E subentendido\", disse. \"O importante e que o ministro deu uma demonstracao cabal de que concorda com a proposta dos precatorios. Se ele nao concordasse a proposta nao existiria\", acrescentou. Por isso, explicou, tecnicamente o ministro tem razao ao dizer que nao pode haver uma vinculacao direta na legislacao entre as reducoes de precatorios e o programa que vai suceder o Bolsa Familia. \"Mas isso nao muda nada. E uma bobagem. O governo precisa buscar uma 'sobra' no orcamento. E o espaco e esse\", afirmou. \"Nos precisamos achar um dinheiro no orcamento do pais para atender 10 milhoes de brasileiros. Essa e uma forma. Nao e calote.\" O tema foi discutido em ao menos tres reunioes no Planalto nos ultimos dois dias, com a presenca de Bolsonaro e Guedes. Na terca, participaram Luiz Eduardo Ramos (Secretaria de Governo), Fabio Faria (Comunicacoes), e os presidentes do Banco Central, Roberto Campos Neto, e do  BNDES ,  Gustavo  Montezano. Uma nova reuniao ocorreu na manha de ontem, com a presenca apenas de Jorge Oliveira (Secretaria-Geral). A lideranca do governo Congresso so entrou nas conversas na noite de ontem. Nessa ultima reuniao, estavam Ricardo Barros (PPPR), lider na Camara, Fernando Bezerra (MDB-PE), lider no Senado, alem de Braga Netto (Casa Civil), Jorge, Ramos e Campos Neto. Todos sairam do palacio sem falar.\n",
